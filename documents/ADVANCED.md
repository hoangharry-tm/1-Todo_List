### 1. Authentication & Database Manipulation

In this particular level, I have started with the Authentication part first, by
moving the home page at the root level to the `home/` directory, I assure the
user to access the login page first, instead of the home page. <br/>
For the login options, I provide the followings:

- Email and Password
- Github
- Google

For Github and Google authentication, I use the OAuth library to check the data.

The database I have chosen to store all of the users' data is Google's Firebase.
During the registering and signing in process, there is a challenge regarding
managing global states that I face with:

> The context hooks can only be used to pass the props to components on the same
> page, thus the Global State Management library like Redux come in handy.
