This is the project that I use to learn web development with
[NextJS][NextJS-Link] framework. I will divide this project into **3 main versions**
which demonstrate the learning process of myself from basics concepts to
advanced techniques. Consequently, these 3 versions will be named accordingly
to the level that I am learning in the following sequence:

- Basics
- Intermediate
- Advanced

For each version, I will specify the goals to achieve and also document the
whole process of learning and planning.

> will also includes small notes of the problems I encounter and how I have

#### Skills I have learned from the project

1. NextJS _and_ ReactJS
   - React Hooks
   - Functional Components
   - Conditional Rendering
   - Rendering Lists
   - Type Safety by using TypeScript Types and Interfaces
   - Basics **CRUD API** _and_ **middleware** using NextJS server components
2. Markdown
3. Git and Github
   - Pull Request
   - Git Merge / Rebase / Squash
   - Version Control
   - Gitflow

#### Summary of each level

##### Basics [^1]

In this level I mainly focus on learning the basics of ReactJS, which includes:

- React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Functional Components
- Conditional Rendering, and
- List Rendering

Moreover, apart from learning those mentioned features provided by Nextjs, I
also try to learn HTML / CSS with a CSS pre-processor: SASS. I believe, by
learning the fundamentals first, I can use modern UI frameworks like [shadcn][Shadcn-Link]
or [tailwindCSS][tailwindCSS-Link] more efficient.

##### Intermediate [^2]

After having basic understanding of how ReactJS works, I will spend more time
on learning **server actions** as well as improving the UI of the application
through animations. Here are the goals of this level:

- Learn advanced React Hooks (useContext, useRef, etc.)
- Learn **NextJS API Routing System** _and_ **Middlewares**
- Using ORM library to interact with databases and do basic actions
- Authentication

Last but not least, learning a state management tool like [Redux][Redux-Link]
is also in plan!

##### Advanced [^3]

To wrap up the project, I will refactor the whole code base to have a cleaner
look. Speaking of which, implementing a _clean architecture_ is also an
important aspect in application development in general, thus I plan to refactor
the code base in this specific direction. Ultimately, the last 2 topics that I
want to learn are Lazy Loading and Memoization.
