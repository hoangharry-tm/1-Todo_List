This is the project that I use to learn web development with
[NextJS][NextJS-Link] framework. I will divide this project into **3 main versions**
which demonstrate the learning process of myself from basics concepts to
advanced techniques. Consequently, these 3 versions will be named accordingly
to the level that I am learning in the following sequence:

- Basics
- Intermediate
- Advanced

For each version, I will specify the goals to achieve and also document the
whole process of learning and planning.

> To demonstrate the problem-solving skills as well as for learning purposes, I
> will also includes small notes of the problems I encounter and how I have
> solved it.

#### Skills I have learned from the project

1. NextJS _and_ ReactJS
   - React Hooks
   - Functional Components
   - Conditional Rendering
   - Rendering Lists
   - Type Safety by using TypeScript Types and Interfaces
   - Client-side rendering and Server-side rendering
   - State management with Contexts (`useContext()` hook in ReactJS) and Redux toolkit
   - Integrate Firebase for database usage and manipulation
   - Authentication
   - Basics **CRUD API** _and_ **middleware** using NextJS server components
2. Markdown
3. Git and Github
   - Pull Requests
   - Git Merge / Rebase / Squash
   - Version Control
   - Gitflow

#### Summary of each level

##### Basics [^1]

In this level I mainly focus on learning the basics of ReactJS, which includes:

- React Hooks
- Functional Components
- Conditional Rendering, and,
- List Rendering

Moreover, apart from learning those mentioned features provided by Nextjs, I
also try to learn HTML / CSS with a CSS pre-processor: SASS. I believe, by
learning the fundamentals first, I can use modern UI frameworks like [shadcn][Shadcn-Link]
or [tailwindCSS][tailwindCSS-Link] more efficient.

##### Intermediate [^2]

After having basic understanding of how ReactJS works, I will spend more time
on learning **server actions** as well as managing the global states within components.
Here are the goals of this level:

- Learn advanced React Hooks (useContext, useRef, etc.)
- Know how to create custom hooks
- Improve the project structure
- Learn basic animation in CSS

Last but not least, learning a state management tool like [Redux][Redux-Link]
is also in plan!

##### Advanced [^3]

To wrap up the project, I will refactor the whole code base to have a cleaner
look by implementing a _clean architecture_. Nevertheless, I will try to have the
MVP (Minimal Viable Product) version working first before I could do anything else.
Therefore, my main focus on this level are still:

- Learn **NextJS API Routing System** _and_ **Middlewares** to implement the backend
  logics for the project
- Interact with databases and do basic actions of reading and writing data
- Authentication with
  - Email and password
  - Github Authentication
  - Google Authentication
- Global state management with [Redux][Redux-Link]

Ultimately, that is the end of the project, albeit it is small but I have learned
a lot of new knowledge through it. In the process of doing these projects, I do not
follow any single tutorial to avoid _tutorial hell_ and instead I will try to do
some google search for any problems I faced along the way.

I'm truly happy with the results and thank you for following my journey! Here is
